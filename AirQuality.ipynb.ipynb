Most pollutants exhibited better performance in Prophet as it captures daily and weekly seasonality automatically, while ARIMA has to tune parameters to these seasonal effects. Prophet also was better at managing missing data since it does not rely on values before and after the missing data.\n","\n","2.Feature Importance:\n","\n","Time-based features (hour of day, month) are factors that helped forecast better, as pollution levels change considerably by time of day and the seasons. When including these features, the improvement was seen in the RMSE.\n","\n","3.Residual Analysis:\n","\n","Both the residual plots and the ACF/PACF provided assurance that the residuals behaved like white noise without strong autocorrelation. Therefore, this indicates that the models were able to account for most of the underlying structures, and the errors that were left remaining were random.\n","\n","\n","4.Error Analysis:\n","\n","The models demonstrated slightly higher errors in prediction during the nighttime and periods of sudden weather change. These deviations may have been associated with some unmodeled sources, including traffic patterns, exogenous weather change or instability of the sensor. External weather datasets, or incorporating some dynamic factors to account for sudden weather changes may increase future modeling improvements.\n","\n","5.Feature Engineering Takeaway:\n","No major feature engineering was applied in this assignment.As discussed, Prophet performed the trend and seasonal components automatically. But in future work, we should create more time series features, such as 'Hour of Day' and indicators for 'Weekday/Weekend', to attempt to account for some of these smaller time based components to improve predictions.\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"OiW1AYhTwU_q"}}]}
