# 🌫️ Air Quality Forecasting – 48-Hour Time Series Prediction

This project forecasts key air pollutant levels for the next 48 hours using historical sensor data. It applies time series models like ARIMA and Prophet to pollutants such as CO, NOx, NO2, Benzene, etc., and evaluates performance using RMSE.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Predict the concentration of air pollutants for the next 48 hours
- Apply ARIMA and Prophet forecasting models
- Handle missing sensor data using forward-fill
- Compare models using RMSE
- Visualize trends and model predictions

---

## 🧪 Pollutants Forecasted

- **CO** – Carbon Monoxide
- **NOx** – Nitrogen Oxides
- **NO2** – Nitrogen Dioxide
- **Benzene**
- **NMHC** – Non-Methane Hydrocarbons
- **NO** – Nitric Oxide

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- statsmodels (for ARIMA)
- prophet (for forecasting)
- scikit-learn (for RMSE)
